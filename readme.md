Vitae is a clean, long-scrolling Curriculum Vitae theme. Features include intro image, biography, work history, networks and contact details.

## Vitae uses the free FullSingle plugin
The Vitae WordPress theme uses the free [FullSingle plugin by One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/go/fullsingle) to insert and edit the Vitae layout. Please watch the [FullSingle setup video](https://onepagelove.com/go/fullsingle-setup) to get going.

ps. did you know if you keep the FullSingle plugin activated, you can switch to any WordPress theme (maybe you want a specific blog design) and the Vitae layout will look exactly the same üôè
